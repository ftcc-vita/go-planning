# SAGE 

## Socratic Agent Gamifying Education

### Purpose
Let's start from nothing. No, really!

Go is a game played (to start, anyway) on a 9x9 board. Black goes first, then White. Each places a stone on the intersection of two lines. 
Stones don't move. You lay them down to make ... interesting shapes? I know for certain that some shapes are better than others. (I don't know why yet.)

Let's learn how we learn, and how we teach. Only then can we *properly* build a teaching agent.

SAGE will involve the AI and humans learning to play Go, and understand Go in their own way.
